# CovidHelpPageController
This is a simple app view with a UIPageController integrated to display messages and images to help us through this pandemic. Basic views are demonstrated using auto layout, swiping gestures and UIButtons. The project has been developed following the MVC design pattern. All UIs are made programatically.
