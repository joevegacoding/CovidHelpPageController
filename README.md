# CovidHelpPageController
This is a simple app view with a UIPageController integrated to display messages and images to help us through this pandemic. Basic views are demonstrated using auto layout, swiping gestures and UIButtons.

## Design Pattern

The project has been developed following the MVC design pattern. All necessary extensions have been created in separate files.

## User InterFace & User Experience

All UIs are made programatically to present a more flexible way of creating components. The Apple Human interface has been followed to make the app more appealing and easy to use.
